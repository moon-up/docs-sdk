# What Can Moon Do?

### General Overview

Moon is a highly composable wallet and authentication product designed to simplify user-friendly, AI-compatible dApp development. Moon is compatible with all standard EVM blockchains, as well as Bitcoin & Cosmos-based chains, allowing developers to offer users a universal experience regardless of where their apps are built.

Moon enables users to onboard to Web3 apps using their existing social accounts (Google, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) for authentication, greatly lowering the barrier of entry for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology. More experienced users can authenticate using their existing EVM wallets. Mobile users can also authenticate using Passkey for a highly-secure, hardware-based authentication method.

Once authenticated, a wallet is created for users, allowing them to interact with any Web3-enabled features in your app. The easiest way to build an app with Moon is through the [SDK](../sdks/), and for already-built apps seeking to integrate Web3 technology, an extensive [API](../api/) can be utilized to easily enable users to perform blockchain operations, such as transfers & smart contract interactions, within your app.

Moon also features an extensive library for building AI-augmented applications using [Langchain](../langchain.md).\

### High-Level Architecture

![](<../moon-sdk/Moon Documentation 58cadf8d24b64b3c90fb5137d98fd9c2/Moon Overview d7cea3031453418b9610b3c21d3fcbe3/What Can Moon Do 74d061268b68403dbb078374c7035be4/Untitled.png>)

The Moon API, specifically designed for Moon's wallet, authentication, and data infrastructure, integrates mpc-tts + hsm via HashiCorp Vault for secure storage of authenticated private keys. It enables users to sign transactions from their wallets and obtain a secure JSON Web Token (JWT).

Users can construct and sign transactions using methods akin to those in ethers.js, facilitating interaction with the blockchain through custom APIs and account abstraction mechanisms. The transaction data is then accessible for further operations.

Moon offers a robust package ecosystem with support for a variety of libraries and languages. This includes viem, wagmi, and rainbowkit for front-end development, ethers for Ethereum blockchain interactions, and programming languages such as Golang, Python, and Langchain for backend development. This diverse support allows developers to choose the tools that best fit their project requirements, promoting flexibility and efficiency in development.\
