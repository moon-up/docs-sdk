# What Can Moon Do?

### General Overview

Moon is a highly composable wallet and authentication product designed to simplify user-friendly, AI-compatible dApp development. Moon is compatible with all standard EVM blockchains, as well as Bitcoin & Cosmos-based chains, allowing developers to offer users a universal experience regardless of where their apps are built.

Moon enables users to onboard to Web3 apps using their existing social accounts (Google, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) for authentication, greatly lowering the barrier of entry for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology. More experienced users can authenticate using their existing EVM wallets. Mobile users can also authenticate using Passkey for a highly-secure, hardware-based authentication method.

Once authenticated, a wallet is created for users, allowing them to interact with any Web3-enabled features in your app. The easiest way to build an app with Moon is through the [SDK](../sdks/), and for already-built apps seeking to integrate Web3 technology, an extensive [API](../api/) can be utilized to easily enable users to perform blockchain operations, such as transfers & smart contract interactions, within your app.

Moon also features an extensive library for building AI-augmented applications using [Langchain](../langchain.md).\

### High-Level Architecture

Moon GPT, Moon SDK, Moon pre-built components, and Moon React Boilerplate seamlessly interact with the Moon API, which offers a comprehensive library of endpoints for direct engagement with the blockchain. Specifically tailored for Moon's wallet, authentication, and data infrastructure, the Moon API facilitates user authentication, allowing users to sign transactions from their wallets and acquire a secure JSON Web Token (JWT). The authenticated private keys are securely stored in the HashCorp Vault.

Users can construct and sign transactions using methods similar to those in ether.js. The transaction data is then available for custom APIs and account abstraction mechanisms to interact with the blockchain. The Moon API extends its capabilities to Moon's data infrastructure, enabling smooth interactions with Moon data. This data can be seamlessly linked to databases like PostgreSQL or other indexing software, providing a user-friendly navigation experience through the blockchain.
