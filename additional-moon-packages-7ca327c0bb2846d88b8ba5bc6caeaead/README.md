# Moon Packages

Moon has a collection of packages and tools that can be used to build and customize a user interface for a wallet that interacts with various blockchains, including Ethereum. To help with this, we recommend using the following packages from the `@moonup` organization:

\
`@moonup/moon-sdk`: This is the core package of Moon, which handles authentication and initialization. It provides a convenient way to integrate Moon's services into your application.

These packages can be used individually or in combination to build a customized user interface for a Moon-based wallet that meets your specific needs. They provide a range of functionality for interacting with Moon's services and the Ethereum blockchain, and can be integrated into a variety of React-based dApps using popular libraries such as WAGMI, Viem, and RainbowKit.
